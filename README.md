# Easy Bulk Certificate Maker
A repo that helps you to create certificates in bulk easily

## Requirements to execute the file:-
  1. a gmail account💌 for the requirement of Google Collab😅.
  2. an internet connection for executing code in colab.
  3. minute know how of programming language 🐍python and a 😏knack to learn.[basic knowledge of ```google collab```,```pandas```,```opencv``` is a plus point but not a mandate.]
  
## How to execute:-

Simply click on the run button in Collab for each cell. The ```▶``` button on the left hand corner of each cell.


## Understanding the code

1. Import all necessary files needed for processing.
2. Now in order to create the certificates in bulk, we need names in bulk which must be provided in ***excel*** file and same must be uploaded in the window when asked for during execution.
3. (Now real cheesy🧀 layer comes into play😋) Panda is used to read excel file and then extract data from it wherein user needs to specify the column with names explicitly which shall be made even more customized in future🔮.
4. Upload the template of the certificate as *```.png```* through files explorer of collab.
